# Unreleased

# 1.3.0

- Deprecate `EscapeUtils.escape_url` and `EscapeUtils.unescape_url` given that Ruby 2.5 provides an optimized `CGI.escape` and `CGI.unescape` with mostly similar performance.

- Deprecate `escape_html` and `escape_html_as_html_safe` given that Ruby 2.5 optimized `CGI.escapeHTML` to be twice faster than the `EscapeUtils` implementation.
- Deprecate `unescape_html` given that Ruby 2.5 optimized `CGI.unescapeHTML` to be only 40% slower than th `EscapeUtils` implementation.
- Deprecate `escape_html_as_html_safe` as well.
- Deprecate `EscapeUtils.html_safe`, there's no reason to escape for slashes `/` in 2022.
